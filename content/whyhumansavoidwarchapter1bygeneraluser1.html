Our interactions with the Terran Union up until this point supported those conclusions. They had not fought any wars among themselves in centuries, and had formed a unified world government prior to achieving FTL travel. They had responded with eagerness rather than hostility to first contact, unlike many species.</span></p>

For example, a few years ago, the expansionist Xanik claimed a Terran mining colony as their territory. The Federation braced itself for a minor conflict, as they expected the humans to defend their outpost. But the humans simply shrugged and agreed to hand off the planet, for a small yearly fee. Rather than going to war, the Terrans somehow ended up as prominent trading partners for the Xanik.</span></p>

Imprisoning diplomats with zero evidence was a clear provocation to war, but the humans did nothing. They didn't even raid the facility where their representatives were being held! They simply opened backchannel negotiations with the Hoda'al and arranged a prisoner exchange, swapping a few smugglers for their people.</span></p>

Some in the Federation found their pacifism commendable, and appreciated their even-tempered statesmanship. Others thought that it was weakness that led them to avoid war. I was in the latter camp; the only reason not to respond to blatant insults with aggression was that they didn't have the wits or the strength for it.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

We didn't know much about them, but we called them the Devourers since their sole mission was to drain stars of their energy. I can't tell you why they would do such a thing. Whatever their reasons, they would take one system by force, suck it dry, and move on to the next.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

We fought as hard as we could, and it didn't matter. Our weapons hardly seemed to scratch their ships. It was a tough decision, but I ordered what was left of the fleet to retreat. As much as we needed to stop them, we would lose the entire armada if we stuck around any longer.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

There were other species with lesser, but still potent, militaries within the Federation. But my request was returned with silence. Not a single one of those cowards volunteered to help. Hearing of our defeat, I suppose they decided to flee and fend for themselves.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

How ironic, the only ones who came to our aid were the galactic pushovers. There were only five of them according to our sensors, which was not nearly enough to mount a fight. A pathetic showing, but it was more than the zero ships that had been sent by the other Federation powers.</span></p>

<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">"With five ships?

"You think humans are a peaceful species? What the hell? Why would you think that?"</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

"No, it's because we know what we are. What we're capable of. And nobody's deserved&nbsp;<em>that</em>&nbsp;quite yet."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The idea of Terrans making ominous threats would have been a joke to me before now, but something in Rykov's tone told me he believed what he was saying with conviction. This was a clear case of delusion stemming from a lack of experience with interstellar warfare. The Devourers would make fools of the Earthlings, and punish them for their overconfidence. However, if the Commander really wanted to send his men to a slaughter, I would not stop him.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">"If you insist on fighting, I certainly won't stand in your way.

We've never actually used one before, since in about five percent of simulations, they don't stop with localized entities and consume all matter in the universe." Commander Rykov said this way too casually for my liking. "But, we programmed them to self-destruct after a few seconds, which will probably work. Ensign Carter, fire at the enemy in five seconds."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

"Wait, hold up, you just said it could destroy everything..."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The Terran flagship fired a missile before I could get in another word to stop them. At first, I thought that they had missed their mark. The projectile sailed through the Devourer fleet, not connecting with a single ship. Then, it detonated at the rear of the formation, and all hell broke loose.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

The force was so powerful that our sensors could only provide an error message as measurement. At least a third of the Devourer fleet was instantly vaporized, as an improbable amount of energy and heat turned them to metal soup. There was no way any occupants of those ships lived through that.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The enemy vessels further out from ground zero survived the initial blast, though many of them sustained heavy damage. But an invisible force seemed to be slowly dissecting each of them; I could only watch in disbelief as the mighty cruisers disintegrated bit by bit. I suppose the bomb had thrown out a swarm of nanobots, which had attacked the ships' structure on a molecular level.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">The Devourers hardly knew what hit them. By the time they thought to return fire, there was nothing left to return fire with. Their arsenal evaporated in a matter of seconds, and undoubtedly, their personnel suffered the same fate. Where there had once been an unstoppable army, now only stood empty space.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

Horror shot through my veins at the thought that they might one day turn their monstrous weapons on the Federation. There was no way to defend oneself against such diabolical creations.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

The kind of species that would invent weapons like that was no 2. Glancing around at my crew, I saw stunned and aghast reactions that mirrored my own. If they ever became hostile, the humans represented a threat of the highest level. They could more than likely wipe out the entire galaxy without breaking a sweat.</span></p>

You should have just invited us to the party to start with!" Commander Rykov grinned. "Tell you what, General, next time we meet, you owe us a beer."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>

The humans could ask for much more than a drink if they wanted to. "Yeah, I think we can do that."</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
<p style="text-align: start; text-justify: inter-ideograph; line-height: 115%; margin-bottom: 1rem; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; orphans: 2; widows: 2; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; word-spacing: 0px;"><span style="font-size: 14pt; line-height: 115%; font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;">Commander Rykov terminated the call, and I watched as the Terran ships warped back into hyperspace. I was still trying to wrap my mind around the whole thing, and I wondered how I was going to put this into words for the combat report. The Federation had no idea who the Terrans truly were, but I was going to make sure they did.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family: 'times new roman', times, serif;"> </span></p>
